# Calculator Project
### University Assignment

This is a Calculator project I created for a university assginement. In this Maven project you can solve both infix and postfix expressions ie "2 * 21" or "19 1 /". This project allows a GUI view or a simpler console view for the calculator. 

In order to run the project (calc code and junit tests) open the project using Maven and insure that you read through the pom.xml file to insure your dependencies are correct. In order to run the code, simply run the Driver class and input a choice of 1/2 depending on which view you wish to use.

This repository was initially on the university gitlab account. Unfortunately, my univerities admins have made it difficult to export the original repo to github. However you can see right below how I developed the code into the original uni repo:

"Within this project I have used a series of branches for seperate features. These branches typically Branch off the candidate-release branch.
For features I belived I wanted to release to the client (in spirit of agile developemnt), I cut branch tags for them.
The Code has been tested with TDD as well as further system testing and compatibility testing. As well as adequete documentation"

Furthermore, I have split the java code into 3 packages, to create a cleaner workspace. Making it easier to maintain and work on.
I have also used git pipelines within my project to ensure that the quality of my code when committed meets the standards defined, and passes it tests. The final code is the most recent release within the main branch (with full functionality as specified).

Additional UML documentation is also provided for this project, in order to visually understand the design patterns used in this project.

Thanks,
